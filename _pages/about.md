I’m an MLIS student at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro and a library associate at Durham County Library currently working in adult services. I’m passionate about connecting people with the information, technology, and resources they need to thrive. My work centers on planning unique presentations with local professors and experts to make learning fun for adults as well as ensuring equitable access to library services for underserved communities and bridging the digital divide. Libraries play a vital role in fostering lifelong learning and community connection, and I’m dedicated to upholding those values through responsive and inclusive programming. 

While I plan to continue working in adult services after graduation, I also have a number of other career interests, including collection development, web design, research, and lecturing. My professional goal is to empower patrons and help other library professionals do the same, no matter what specialty I end up in. 


A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured Markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various Markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
