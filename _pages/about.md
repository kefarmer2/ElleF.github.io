**************
<h2>Hi, I'm Elle!</h2>

I’m an MLIS student at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro and a library associate at Durham County Library currently working in adult services. I’m passionate about connecting people with the information, technology, and resources they need to thrive. My work centers on planning unique presentations with local professors and experts to make learning fun for adults as well as ensuring equitable access to library services for underserved communities and bridging the digital divide. Libraries play a vital role in fostering lifelong learning and community connection, and I’m dedicated to upholding those values through responsive and inclusive programming. 

While I plan to continue working in adult services after graduation, I also have a number of other career interests, including collection development, web design, research, and lecturing. My professional goal is to empower patrons and help other library professionals do the same, no matter what specialty I end up in.
